# Releasing toolbelt-upkeep

The pinned SDK supplies the shared release CLI; no sibling Toolbelt checkout is required.
Use Bun 1.4.4 and authenticated GitHub CLI from a clean, up-to-date main checkout.

```sh
bun run release:plugin --version 1.3.0 --channel stable
bun run release:plugin --version 1.3.0-rc.1 --channel prerelease --check
bun run release:plugin:retry --tag v1.3.0
```

Versions are examples. Preparation synchronizes package.json/toolbelt.json and the changelog,
commits the release request and opens a PR. --check validates/builds in temporary staging without
writing to GitHub or tracked files. Missing arguments fail without prompting.

**Merging the validated release PR authorizes CI publication.** Ordinary feature merges do not
publish. CI builds the exact merged source, tests the actual archives on supported native runners,
freezes files/hashes, creates an annotated tag/draft, downloads and verifies every uploaded byte,
then publishes. Stable releases become this repository's Latest; prereleases do not. The engine
also uploads release-record.json. Local build/package commands never publish.

Retry reuses the original candidate; it never overwrites published bytes or moves tags. A failed
build can run again before the candidate is saved. Retained CI candidates expire after 90 days;
if a draft/public release exists but exact files cannot be recovered, stop and use a new version.
See the [shared release reference](https://github.com/tkarakai/toolbelt/blob/main/docs/releases.md)
for permissions, authorization, artifact retention and failure recovery.

The adapter bundles the plugin/migration and packages darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64. Both native runners must pass.
Plugin behavior tests remain here; shared archive/schema/lifecycle validation is supplied by the
SDK development entry point and does not enter the plugin runtime bundle. Keep required host/Bun
ranges and capabilities accurate. Update the exact public SDK URL and lockfile together when
upgrading tooling; publish compatible SDK/host prerequisites before consuming new functionality.
Use isolated profiles, temporary homes and disposable resources for smoke tests.
